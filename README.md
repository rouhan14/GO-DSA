# Data Structures and Algorithms in Go (Educative)

This repository contains my implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Go as part of my DSA course on Educative. It includes various fundamental and advanced topics in DSA, implemented using the Go programming language.

## 📌 Topics Covered
- 📂 Arrays and Slices
- 🔗 Linked Lists
- 📦 Stacks and Queues
- 🔑 Hash Tables
- 🌳 Trees (Binary Trees, BSTs, Heaps, etc.)
- 🔢 Sorting Algorithms (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
- 🔍 Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, etc.)
- 🔁 Recursion

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Go installed. You can download it from [golang.org](https://golang.org/dl/).

### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/rouhan14/GO-DSA.git
```

### Navigate to the Project Folder
```sh
cd dsa-go-educative
```

### Run a Go File
```sh
go run filename.go
```
Replace `filename.go` with the actual file name you want to execute.
